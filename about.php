            About myself!
          </h1>
          <p class="mt-4 mb-0 aboutme-p">
            Hello to you friend! I'm Ziv. I want to share with you a little bit about myself and my trip to India.<br>
            I'm 24 years old right now, was born and raised in Israel. it was all started only 1.5 years ago when my brother told me "You should go to India, you will love it!", it took me awhile but most of the times I'm listening to him so I found myself buying a ticket for 6 months to India... I was pretty shocked at myself when I did that.<br>
            It happend so fast and I didn't planned anything besides packing a big mochila and a small backpack and I found myself arriving to the airport. I was so nervous, I had so many worries about staying there alone and how my trip will be, I thought to myself "How my trip will go?", "Do I really going to stay there for half a year?", "Who I will be with?" or "Where I'm even going to stay when I'm arriving!?".<br>
            All these questions melt away when I arrived, right when I landed I found myself a company and a place to stay and from then I had the best and biggest experience I ever had in my whole life. Kinda change my life I would say... And I hope I would change something in your mind too!
